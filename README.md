showing 2 ways to cache deps for build

1) with artifactory
2) by building a docker image that contains deps


i used sbt build tool in this example and a seed play framework project via:  
```bash
sbt new playframework/play-scala-seed.g8
```
play framework version is 2.18
I removed the gradle and g8 template related files from the seed project.
